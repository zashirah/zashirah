### Hello. I am a software engineer named Zach Shirah. I have varried experience in the technology field from sales and revenue tech stack operations consulting to data analytics and data science. I recently made the switch to software engineering away from consulting because I find the most join when building projects out with code. I started my analytics and data science journey learning R, SAS, SQL, and Python, but now I'm onto javascript, react.js, mongoDB, ruby on rails, and many other front and backend frameworks/languages. 

#### I am currently looking for a software engineering, data engineering, or data science role in the Atlanta area but am also open to remote work. I have a passion for solving complex problems with code and I'd love an opportunity to work with you. If you have an questios of my abilities as a software enginner please check out any links to my work below:
