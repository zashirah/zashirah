### Hello. I am a software engineer named Zach Shirah. I have varried experience in the technology field from sales and revenue tech stack operations consulting to data analytics and data science. I recently made the switch to software engineering away from consulting because I find the most join when building projects out with code. I started my analytics and data science journey learning R, SAS, SQL, and Python, but now I'm onto javascript, react.js, mongoDB, ruby on rails, and many other front and backend frameworks/languages.
